In this repository you will find a broad range of function used at the Computational Neuromechanics research group at the KU Leuven.

Function are divided in broad categories in the main folder after which they will be further divided in consequent folders. 

Current categories:

- DataProcessing
  - Functions that are useful in processing data, including marker and force data processing, calculation of inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and more.
- Read&Write

In each subfolder folder you will find a README.md file with a description of the files in the respective folder.
