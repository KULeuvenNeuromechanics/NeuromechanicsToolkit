# NeuromechanicsToolkit

In this repository you will find a broad range of functions used at the Computational Neuromechanics research group at the KU Leuven.

Function are divided in categories in the main folder after which they will be further divided in consequent folders. 

Current categories:

- DataProcessing
  - Functions that are useful in processing data, including marker and force data processing, calculation of inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and more.
- Read&Write
  - Functions that read and write data, including function that read .c3d files, write .trc, .mot, .sto files, and more.

In each subfolder you will find a README.md file with a description of the files in the respective folder.
